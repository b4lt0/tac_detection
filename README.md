## Transdermal Alcoholic Concentration Detection Based On Smartphone Accelerometer's Data
_You give it your accelerations, it tells you if you're drunk_

### What is it?
Drinking alcohol can become dangerous when you drive any vehicle.</br>
However, it is **difficult to  check**  whether  a  person  who  wants  to rent an electric  scooter or  bike is  drunk  or  not.</br>
Furthermore, a possible test to be conducted every time you try to access these vehicles would heavily limit their usability.</br>
So, it would be useful, minimally invasive from the point of view of **privacy** and **usability**,</br>
to check the **smartphone accelerometer data**, easily obtainable by the app that the user uses to rent the vehicle.</br>
When alcohol acts on a person's body the way it moves changes,
therefore there could be a relationship </br>between the accelerometer data, 
which describes  the  movements,</br>
and  the **TAC (Transdermal Alcoholic Concentration)**,
that describes whether you are **drunk or not**.</br>

Having found a dataset with the data just mentioned, we apply some machine learning algorithms</br>
to build a model that relates them and can predict if the user is drunk or not (then give him/her access to the vehicle or not).</br>
